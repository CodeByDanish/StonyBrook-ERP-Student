This application offers a variety of permit options to meet students needs,
companiesâ€™ vendors, partners and parking management. The parking
permits can be applied for from the university's portal at different rates and
availability. If the space is full in a requested parking zone, request is
redirected to a waitlist, allowing park a vehicle at the requested parking
zone soon as the parking space is available.
